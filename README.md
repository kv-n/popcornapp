## SUMMARY
This app was a great experience to really put into practice everything we've learned since being introduced to Express, MVC and CRUD. 

Like my first project, I had to find a way to organize my models, routes and views. I knew I wanted to try and include an API but one of the biggest challenges was to organize my routes and models without having any idea on how API works or where I wanted the routes to go once you clicked each movie in the index.

I started with a reviews and users models and included the 7 RESTful routes for each model.

After a lot of confusion with routing and ideas, Mike, our local instructor introduced me to APIs and helped me organize my reviews model. After making the index for the movies and seeing each movie on the screen I had a better understanding of what I wanted to accomplish.

After refactoring my routes for my users and reviews, I realized that I didn't need as many pages and I could route them to the movies show page. There users can add reviews and see all other reviews by each user. 

The most difficult for me was really understanding the routing and where and what I wanted each route to render or redirect to. Unlike my first project, this project really gave you the freedom to give users a unique experience that you wanted. 

In summary, this project really helped reinforced how important the planning stage really is and understanding RESTful routes and MVC (models, views, controller).

I wouldn't have been able to complete this project successfully as I did, without the help of my cohort and my instructors! 

So grab some popcorn and let us know what you think about the movies listed!
